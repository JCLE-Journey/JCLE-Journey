- ⚡ Some Fun facts about me:

1. **Innovative Baker**: Did you know? I've whipped up a healthier twist on the classic chocolate chip cookie by using a homemade blend of lentil and oat flour. They're not only delicious but packed with extra nutrients!

2. **Spiritual Adventurer**: Fun Fact! I journeyed to Mt. Shasta to embark on my shamanic initiation—a transformative experience that deepened my spiritual connection and broadened my perspective on life.

3. **Linguistic Insight**: Here's a trivia tidbit! Many of the subjects I study end with the suffix "-ology." But did you know that this suffix is derived from Greek? The "-o" part means "of," while "-logy" translates to "the study of" or "the science of." So, when you hear "-ology," think "the study of"!

4. **Breakfast Connoisseur**: Fun Fact Alert! My go-to breakfast combo might surprise you: eggs with a side of corn. It's an unexpected pairing that never fails to kickstart my day with a burst of flavor and energy!

5. **Trailblazing Achievements**: Fun Fact! I hold the honor of being the first among my siblings to become ordained. Plus, I'm eagerly awaiting approval for my test in Hellenistic Astrology—an achievement that combines my passion for astrology with a deep dive into ancient wisdom.
